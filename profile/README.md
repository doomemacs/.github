Doom Emacs is an Emacs Lisp development tool and configuration framework for
[GNU Emacs][emacs], tailored for Emacs enthusiasts that want a faster, more
reliable, and reproducible foundation for their next config or elisp project, or
for beginners who want a softer introduction to our favorite operating system.


## Quick start

``` sh
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs ~/.config/emacs
~/.config/emacs/bin/doom install
```

This is the quickest way to get a Doom environment up and running. Visit our
[getting started guide][getting-started] for more in-depth instructions.


## Prerequisites
- Emacs 27.1â€“30.1 **(30.1 is recommended)**
- Git 2.23+
- Ripgrep 11.0+

> [!WARNING]
> Doom core supports 27.1, but Doom's modules requires 28.1 at minimum. Some
> modules (particularly tree-sitter) require 29.1 or newer. Other module
> requirements may apply, so don't forget to run `$ doom doctor` after
> installing Doom!
